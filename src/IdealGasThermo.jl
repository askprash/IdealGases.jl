# `Base.cp` (file copy), so it is deliberately NOT exported; `cₚ` and `c_p` are
# exported aliases of the same function (same methods, including the
# ForwardDiff-extension Dual methods). `cp` stays reachable as `IdealGasThermo.cp`,
# and the `props(gas, T)` NamedTuple field keeps the name `cp` — a field accessor

# deleted in v2.0.0 without touching any live code path. `Xidict2Array` places the
